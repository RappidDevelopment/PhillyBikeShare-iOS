# [Ride Philly](https://github.com/RappidDevelopment/PhillyBikeShare-iOS)

Ride Philly is a free iOS application that helps you locate the closest Indego docking station and how many bikes and open docks are available.

## Build Instructions

You'll need [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) for most of our dependencies.
    
    $ gem install cocoapods
    
Download the source code 

    $ git clone https://github.com/RappidDevelopment/PhillyBikeShare-iOS.git
    $ cd PhillyBikeShare-iOS/
    
Now you'll need to build the dependencies.
    
    $ pod install
    
*Note*: **Don't open the `.xcodeproj`** because we use Cocoapods! Use **`.xcworkspace`**
