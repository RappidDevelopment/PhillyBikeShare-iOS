# Bike Philly

Bike Philly is a free iOS application that helps you locate the closest Indego docking station and how many bikes and open docks are available.

## Build Instructions

You'll need `Cocoapods` for most of our dependencies. [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) in your projects. 
    
    $ gem install cocoapods
    
Download the source code 

    $ git clone https://github.com/RappidDevelopment/PhillyBikeShare-iOS.git
    $ cd PhillyBikeShare-iOS/
    
Now you'll need to build the dependencies.
    
    $ pod install
    
*Note*: **Don't open the `.xcodeproj`** file because we use Cocoapods, use the **`.xcworkspace`** file.
